This code is to demonstrate how YOLO real time object detection can be implmented.
be aware that the demonstration might not run natively on every machine and thus it is recommended that the code is 
imported onto Google Collab for the best and easiest possible results.

To run said demo:

1. simply make the realTimeDemo.py in terminal 

Troubleshooting:
1. issues with dependencies and directory paths may cause conflict and unforseen errors.

THIS IS NOT A SHIPPBLE PROGRAM
